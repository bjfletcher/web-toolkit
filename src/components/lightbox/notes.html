        Bind lightboxes to there content using a hash that translates to the elements ID. i.e. clicking a lightbox link with the href <code>#!weather/editor</code> would display the div with the id <code>weather-editor</code>.

    <p>Please try to use <code>RESTful</code> hashes where possible and ensure the lightbox link has an ID (for accessibility; this helps us label the lightbox for screen-readers)</p>
